        <p>Exacerbations are important for a lot of reasons. One is because patients feel poorly when they have them, and we would therefore like to try and prevent them, or treat them rapidly when they occur. So, we believe that exacerbations are part of what drives the ongoing inflammation and progression of bronchiectasis.</p>
        <p>And a lot of that is why we&rsquo;re trying to prevent these events, to try and prevent that progression of disease. But something we learned is, we tend to focus on the acute things, like the cough and the sputum production, and we measure things like missed days of work or school; and those are all important. But the other thing is these are systemic events. And even though their symptoms of cough or chest complaints may improve rapidly, we actually now have data that show that their physical functioning takes weeks before they recover. And that&rsquo;s not unlike any other kind of lung infection. And that&rsquo;s a factor I think we have to pay attention to.</p>
        <p>You know, one of the reasons we want to prevent exacerbations is we know they&rsquo;re associated with some bad outcomes, worsening quality of life, and, very importantly, disease progression, and even mortality. So we really need to focus on preventing these exacerbations for our patients.</p>
        <p>When patients have bronchiectasis exacerbations, it may lead to, you know, frequent outpatient visits, frequent hospitalizations, if not treated appropriately, you know, worsening symptoms, worsening quality of life. Oftentimes, they&rsquo;re trying to help themselves, right? So it leads to more time consumed at home with medical, you know, using certain medications or certain devices. It&rsquo;s just very cumbersome for the patient when they&rsquo;re faced with exacerbations. You want to, you know, try to optimize quality of life as best possible for these patients. You know, you want to prevent any sort of worsening lung function from exacerbations or any sort of, you know, worsening inflammation and worsening bronchiectasis, right? So I think it&rsquo;s very important to identify these exacerbations and treat it appropriately early.</p>

        <p>Let me just talk a little bit about bronchiectasis and its pathophysiology. There is an impairment of its normal mucociliary clearance function, and when that is abnormal, it becomes a ripe place for opportunistic bacteria to set up shop. With that growth of bacteria then comes an influx of inflammation. That inflammation, although it&rsquo;s necessary to combat the bacteria, unfortunately is also injurious to the normal tissues. And so, you then get this injury to the airway. It again more adversely affects the mucociliary clearance, and thus begins the cycle. It just keeps feeding upon itself. Historically, that&rsquo;s what led to the terms, the vicious cycle of pathophysiology of bronchiectasis. That was the traditional model, but what we&rsquo;ve learned is it&rsquo;s not one step feeds the next. Each one feeds the others. So that impaired mucociliary clearance not only allows for mucus retention, it also prevents the inflammation from being cleared. It incites more inflammation for coming in. The inflammation is causing injury to the airway walls, but so are products from the bacteria. And so, it wasn&rsquo;t just a one step feeds the other, each is feeding the others, so that&rsquo;s why we called it a vortex.</p>
        <p>Each of these processes are interconnected, and one often begets the other. So the bacterial infection doesn&rsquo;t just cause direct injury, but it incites inflammation, and the white blood cells release products, such as serine proteases, that will cause more inflammation and damage. One example is that these serine proteases will directly induce increased secretion of mucus, which may have been the body&rsquo;s attempt to respond to this inflammation and injury, but can result in more mucus plugging. Therefore, more difficulty in clearing the secretions, and you get this interconnection.</p>
        <p>When we talk about the vicious vortex, when you have inflammation, it&rsquo;s important to try to treat that because if inflammation is not well controlled, it can lead to further bronchiectasis and furthering lung destruction and kind of perpetuates that vortex into worsening lung function overall. And managing one step still may lead to perpetuation of bronchiectasis and inflammation and worsening lung destruction. So even if you try to intervene on one of those steps, for example, we know that airway clearance is an important management strategy, but it may not be enough to disrupt the cycle or vortex.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I think antibiotics are another example. Just treating someone for their bacterial infection does not necessarily affect further lung destruction, because there may be other mechanisms that underlie the inflammation that results in destruction.</p>

        <p>Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease marked by permanent, abnormal dilation of the bronchi and chronic airway inflammation. While there are various etiologies of bronchiectasis such as infection, COPD, asthma, and GERD, in many patients the etiology cannot be identified (idiopathic bronchiectasis). Common symptoms of bronchiectasis include a chronic cough with sputum production, dyspnea, fatigue, and hemoptysis. Many patients suffer from repeated exacerbations, generally defined by an increase in daily respiratory symptoms and potential change in therapy. Increased frequency of exacerbations can be associated with disease progression and reduced quality of life. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires both the presence of signs and symptoms such as chronic productive cough or history of exacerbations, and radiological evidence, often via a high-resolution computed tomography scan.</p>
        <p>Bronchiectasis pathophysiology has been described in literature as a "vicious cycle" or "vicious vortex," consisting of 4 interconnected components: abnormal mucus production and mucociliary clearance, where thick mucus becomes trapped in the airways, which renders the airway more susceptible to chronic infections. The inflammatory response is complex. It is primarily neutrophilic, but also involves a network of cytokines and other inflammatory cells, including macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Collectively, these add to airway damage and lung destruction. Within this self-perpetuating process, each component can contribute to the worsening of the others and thereby furthers the progression of disease over time.</p>
        <p>Neutrophilic inflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of bronchiectasis.</p>
        <p>Neutrophils are immune cells with antimicrobial properties. As neutrophils mature in the bone marrow, neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) are activated by dipeptidyl peptidase-1 (DPP-1) and packaged into azurophil granules. Once matured, neutrophils enter the bloodstream, where, upon stimuli such as an infection, they are transported along a chemotactic gradient and exit the bloodstream at the site of infection.</p>
        <p>Neutrophils exert several host defense mechanisms, including antimicrobial functions such as the release of cytokines to recruit other immune cells, engulfment of microbes via phagocytosis, degranulation to release antimicrobial NSP molecules like neutrophil elastase, and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Once neutrophils have executed their antimicrobial processes, they are eliminated via apoptosis to avoid further damage.</p>
        <p>However, in bronchiectasis, chronic infection and changes in the airway environment can lead to neutrophil dysregulation. This results in amplified numbers of neutrophils that not only survive longer but also lead to increased NSP activity and NET formation. NE activity and NETs have been associated with bronchiectasis disease severity and progression. This unresolved inflammatory process contributes to tissue damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, impaired bacterial phagocytosis, and killing resulting in airway damage.</p>
        <p>Targeting the underlying neutrophilic inflammation associated with bronchiectasis continues to be an unmet need, and a comprehensive treatment approach is desirable. Current treatment efforts are targeted towards other components of the disease, such as antibiotics to treat chronic bacterial infection and long-term mucoactive therapies and airway clearance techniques to improve mucociliary clearance and reduce airway damage. However, individual treatments may not halt disease progression, as chronic neutrophilic inflammation and airway destruction can still be sustained by other stimuli.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a comprehensive multimodal treatment approach that addresses all 4 interrelated components of bronchiectasis may help to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in bronchiectasis patients and improve their quality of life.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s important to take a multimodal treatment approach when you&rsquo;re dealing with a patient with bronchiectasis, because there&rsquo;s so many factors that are involved. We want to identify the potential etiology, the potential comorbidities to try to reduce the progression of the bronchiectasis. We want to try to reduce inflammation. You know, oftentimes, you know with airway clearance being a mainstay of that management, we want to try to treat infections and, you know, treat exacerbations and try to prevent exacerbations to really try to hinder the vicious vortex and prevent further progression of their bronchiectasis.</p>
        <p>You know, we have multiple ways we can treat our patients with bronchiectasis, and if we reflect back on the vicious cycle and the vicious vortex, there are multiple places we can intervene to try to improve our patients&rsquo; symptoms and achieve all the objectives that we are trying to achieve. So we ought to be focusing on all the areas of the vortex to be able to optimize the management of our patients. And I know it&rsquo;s hard to do that, but I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
        <p>Targeting 1 aspect is not going to break the cycle in most patients, because it&rsquo;s not just infection, or not just noninfectious inflammation, or not just problems with clearance of secretions. They all feed back on each other. So if you treat the retained mucus with airway clearance but you don&rsquo;t treat the infection, you&rsquo;re going to have an incomplete response. And vice versa, if you treat the infection and you don&rsquo;t treat, say, underlying cause of inflammation, you&rsquo;re still going to have dysfunction, ongoing inflammation, and all the negative effects of that.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and a key part of what you&rsquo;re describing there is people need to understand this is a chronic condition. This is not like an acute pneumonia and antibiotics, it&rsquo;s all going to be gone and they&rsquo;re done. They&rsquo;re going to have it for the rest of their lives. And so chronic illness requires chronic therapies, and so you need to have some kind of daily regimen to manage that.</p>

        <p>Bronchiectasis is defined as dilatation of the airways that&rsquo;s irreversible. Patients with bronchiectasis generally have chronic cough, often with sputum production, and will often have exacerbations. However, it&rsquo;s important to know that it&rsquo;s a very heterogeneous condition. There&rsquo;s a large variety of underlying causes, and a huge spread in how symptomatic patients are.</p>
        <p>A lot of patients with bronchiectasis are misdiagnosed as having some other kind of pulmonary disease, like COPD or asthma. And, really, the only way that I know to differentiate that is with a chest CT scan. And that is what we order, mostly, a high-resolution chest CT for the first scan, but we would often use lower-dose radiation for follow-up scans. But how about you?</p>
        <p>No, that&rsquo;s exactly right. And I think it&rsquo;s important to really look for the radiologic diagnosis of bronchiectasis, right? So we may have a patient that presents with cough, abnormal pulmonary function testing, right? But if we&rsquo;re suspecting bronchiectasis, we should get that chest imaging, right, either a chest X-ray, but, most often, a CAT scan of the chest, because that&rsquo;s really how we&rsquo;re going to see the dilated airways and really diagnose bronchiectasis.</p>
        <p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s important that we look for certain features, right, looking at an airway to artery diameter to define that enlarged airway, lack of tapering, visibility of the airways in the periphery. I mean, there&rsquo;s some very specific things that our radiologists will be looking for that should help us make that diagnosis of bronchiectasis.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and I think it&rsquo;s important for us to review images ourselves, too, right? So not just always rely on the report, because it may or may not mention bronchiectasis, but when you review it independently, you may pick up bronchiectasis, even mild cases, right, that may not have been mentioned.</p>
        <p>Yeah, we all see this. We see the reports that don&rsquo;t mention bronchiectasis, but when we see the scan, we see the bronchiectasis.</p>

        <p>Obviously, we have to treat a lot of infections in patients with bronchiectasis from multiple different causes. So, it&rsquo;s very important that we get a sputum culture to direct that therapy. Once you&rsquo;ve identified the pathogen, you have drug-susceptibility results, you can now better target the treatment. How long we treat is debatable. Current recommendations have said 14 days, which is what I do in my practice.</p>
        <p>Yeah, and I think it&rsquo;s important to highlight, it&rsquo;s not just the bacterial sputum culture that we&rsquo;re checking, but also the AFB sputum culture, the fungal sputum culture as well, because these patients with bronchiectasis may be colonized with bacteria, right? So MRSA, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Haemophilus</em>, but also other organisms such as NTM, <em>Aspergillus</em>. So, we want to try to identify the appropriate organism to treat to see if they respond to therapy.</p>
        <p>And that last point, you want to figure out if they&rsquo;re responding. If they&rsquo;re not responding, you have to decide, you know, is that because you got the wrong organism to treat, you picked the wrong antibiotic, or it&rsquo;s acquired resistance? And then, you may have to treat again. But what we want to avoid is just one course after the next course, after the next. I think in those settings, it may not even be an infection. And you need to really stop and think, What is causing their symptoms or their worsening symptoms?</p>

        <p>So, there are several different modalities for airway clearance. There are the more simple-to-use, handheld, positive expiratory pressure vibratory devices. So, for patients who are less severe, I&rsquo;m going to always start with one of the handheld devices because it&rsquo;s easier for them to use. So that&rsquo;s the discussion I&rsquo;ll have with the patient. If they&rsquo;re doing well, great. If they&rsquo;re not, then we talk about whether to add a modality such as hypertonic saline, which again increases the time that they have to spend and as well can cause cough, so some patients don&rsquo;t tolerate it. And certainly the high-frequency chest wall oscillation vest is always an option. But for me, it&rsquo;s, I won&rsquo;t say the last resort, but I hold off on it until I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that the patient needs it.</p>
        <p>And the other thing that we really encourage is exercise. So aerobic exercise, again, a role for pulmonary rehabilitation perhaps, but to try to get them to just get that breathing. And the final thing I want to say about these devices is you can&rsquo;t just give it to them. You have to teach them how to do it. And so that&rsquo;s why having a respiratory therapist that you can either have on the team or have for consultation or someone else who&rsquo;s got expertise in the education to make sure that they&rsquo;re using it effectively. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve had people say, “This thing doesn&rsquo;t work.” And then when we put them through some active cycle breathing with a device, they just keep coughing and clearing up sputum. And so key to all this is, the one that will work the best is the one that the patient will do.</p>
